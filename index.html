        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and exceptionally weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild. Its most recognisable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.</p>

                <li> Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their power and strength.</li>
                <li> The tiger is capable of killing animals over twice its size; it is one of natureâ€™s most feared predators.</li>
                <li>Tigers live alone and aggressively scent-mark large territories (up to 100sq km in size) to keep their rivals away.
 </li>
                <li>They are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals. A Bengal tiger can eat 21kg of meat in a night and can kill the equivalent of 30 buffaloes a year.
</li>
                <li> The roar of a Bengal tiger can carry for over 2km at night.
